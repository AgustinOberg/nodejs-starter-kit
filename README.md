This is a starter project for Node.js with Express and MongoDB using the Serverless Framework.

## Features

- **Node.js 18.x:** Utilize the latest version of Node.js for your project.
- **Express:** Build RESTful APIs and web applications with the popular Express.js framework.
- **MongoDB:** Connect and interact with MongoDB databases using Mongoose.
- **Serverless:** Deploy your application as serverless functions using the Serverless Framework.
- **Environment Variables:** Manage environment-specific configurations using .env files.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18.x or higher
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 5.x or higher (a fast package manager)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (or you can use a cloud-hosted MongoDB service)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nodejs-starter.git
   cd nodejs-starter
   ```

2. Install project dependencies using pnpm:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Create the necessary environment files:

   - `.env.development`: Configuration for the development environment.
   - `.env.production`: Configuration for the production environment.
   - `.env.test`: Configuration for the testing environment.

   You can use the provided `.env.example` file as a template.

### Usage

- Run the development server:

  ```bash
  pnpm run dev
  ```

- Run tests with code coverage:

  ```bash
  pnpm run coverage
  ```

- Deploy to development environment:

  ```bash
  pnpm run deploy:development
  ```

- Deploy to production environment:

  ```bash
  pnpm run deploy:production
  ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `.env.development`: Configuration for the development environment.
- `.env.production`: Configuration for the production environment.
- `.env.test`: Configuration for the testing environment.

Make sure to update these files with your specific configurations.

### Serverless Configuration

1. Open the `serverless.yml` file and replace the following placeholders with your own values:

   - `org`: Your organization name.
   - `app`: Your Serverless Framework application name.
   - `service`: The name of your service or project.
   - `stage`: The deployment stage (e.g., `dev`, `prod`).
   - `region`: The AWS region where you want to deploy.

   ```yaml
   org: your-organization-name
   app: your-serverless-app-name
   service: your-service-name
   stage: dev
   region: us-east-1
   ```

2. You can further customize the `serverless.yml` file to configure your AWS resources, endpoints, and other settings according to your project requirements.

Remember to keep your sensitive information, such as AWS access keys or database credentials, secure and avoid committing them to version control. It's a good practice to use environment variables or a secrets management solution to handle such sensitive data.
